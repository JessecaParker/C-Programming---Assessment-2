# C-Programming---Assessment-2

In the first project, titled "u2a1 Part 1", was the first time I used else/if
statements. I used numbers inputted by the user to output solutions based off
of the numbers entered by the user.

In the second project, titled "u2a1 Part 2", using variables that were hardcoded,
and using two numbers inputted by the user, I calculated the gross pay, total taxes,
and the net pay of the user.

In the third project, titled "u2a1 Part 3", I calculated the cost of a trip based
on number of passengers, miles traveled, going to the airport or not.
